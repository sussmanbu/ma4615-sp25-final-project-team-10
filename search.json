    "text": "Data Set 1: National Registry of Exonerations (https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx)\nOne data set we are considering for our project on racial disparities is the National Registry of Exonerations (NRE). This data set (3659 rows, 22 columns) tracks cases of wrongful convictions in the United States and provides detailed information about exonerees, including their race, age, crime type, conviction and exoneration dates, and factors that contributed to their wrongful conviction. The registry, maintained through a collaborative effort involving law schools, innocence organizations, and legal researchers, is designed to shed light on patterns of wrongful convictions and the systemic issues within the justice system. With over 3,000 recorded cases, this data set offers a valuable opportunity to explore how different factors—such as mistaken witness identification, false confessions, or official misconduct—affect exonerees from various racial backgrounds.\nBy analyzing this data, we hope to examine whether racial disparities exist in wrongful convictions and, if so, how they manifest. For instance, do Black exonerees experience official misconduct at a higher rate than white exonerees? Are certain crime types—such as drug offenses or homicides—more likely to lead to wrongful convictions for particular racial groups? Do certain factors—such as official misconduct, inaccurate forensic evidence, or eyewitness misidentification—disproportionately affect exonerees of particular racial groups? Additionally, we want to explore whether exonerees from different racial backgrounds serve significantly different amounts of time before being exonerated. From a practical standpoint, the data comes in a relatively well-structured spreadsheet format (although it is sometimes updated with new cases and additional fields). Loading it into a data analysis environment should be fairly straightforward. However, because this registry is compiled from many sources (court documents, news reports, legal filings, etc.), some challenges with missing or inconsistent data can arise. Despite these limitations, we believe this data set provides a powerful lens through which we can better understand inequities in the criminal justice system and contribute to discussions on how to address them.\nData Set 2: COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Race/Ethnicity - ARCHIVE (https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data-Archive/qmgw-5kp6/about_data)\nAnother data set we are considering for our project on racial disparities is the COVID-19 State Level Data - Archive from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH). This dataset tracks state-level COVID-19 metrics and was actively updated until June 1, 2023. It includes 343 rows and 94 columns, offering comprehensive insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing over time. The data provides cumulative and 7-day rolling metrics, covering confirmed and probable cases, test positivity rates, and reported deaths. The dataset offers an opportunity to investigate racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by analyzing statewide trends. Some key questions we hope to explore include: How did COVID-19 case and mortality rates fluctuate over time? Were there significant racial disparities in infection rates and fatalities? How did policy changes, such as testing requirements, impact reported metrics? Additionally, since age-adjusted rates are not directly included, we may need to incorporate external demographic data to better understand disparities.\nFrom a technical perspective, the dataset is well-structured, making it feasible to load into a data analysis environment. However, there are challenges, such as missing data due to delayed reporting and the discontinuation of negative test result tracking after the federal public health emergency ended on May 11, 2023. Despite these limitations, this dataset provides a valuable historical record of state-level COVID-19 impacts and can contribute to broader discussions on health equity and pandemic response policies.\nData Set 3: Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-united-states-3f72f)\nThe third data set we are considering for our final project is the data on drug overdose death rates, by drug type and selected population characteristics. It includes 15 columns and 6229 rows, which is a large dataset that includes necessary information like gender, race, age to help us have a deeper understand of the trends and patterns surrounding drug overdose fatalities across various demographic groups. By capturing detailed breakdowns by gender, race, and age—along with year-to-year changes—this dataset enables us to pinpoint which subpopulations are most severely affected, how overdose rates have evolved over time, and where public health interventions may be most urgently needed. Some interesting questions we can research on: Are there particular racial or ethnic groups that appear to be disproportionately affected by drug overdoses, and how have these disparities evolved over time? Are there notable interactions between age and gender or age and race in overdose patterns, such as certain age brackets being more susceptible among specific demographic groups?\nFrom a techinical perspective, the dataset is well-organized and contains a rich array of demographic variables, making it feasible to load into most data analysis environments. However, there are challenges, such as potential inconsistencies in data reporting across different regions, limited data coverage for certain demographic groups, and possible variations in drug classification over time. Despite these limitations, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing patterns and trends in drug overdose fatalities, and it can contribute to broader public health discussions on prevention strategies, resource allocation, and policy-making."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "This comes from the file data.qmd.\nYour first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.\nI recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

For example, the below is not a useful start to a sentence.\n\n\nThe graph presents a horizontal bar chart …\n\n\nEach page should be largely standalone.\nSometimes small tables or even inline numbers are better than a figure.\nRedundant colors (e.g. bar charts where each bar is a different color that doesn’t signify anything) often don’t help.\nProvide some details on how much data was removed in your cleaning process.\nUse the tidyverse!\nImagine I’m an impatient boss. Show me only what is important and relevant.\nCleaning must be entirely in R\nDon’t say things like, well if only everyone did like so and so than everything would be better. There are many things hiding behind the data that would go to explain things. This is an example of a bad conclusion.\n\n\nThe world could benefit form modeling its education systems after Europe’s.\n\nIt is fine to talk about how the European system is better according to certain metrics, but don’t assume that can easily translate to other regions.\n\nDon’t talk about your “journey”. The blog posts tell the story of your journey. The main pages should focus on the data and your findings.\n\n\nUse the tidyverse!\nNo but seriously, when asking ChatGPT to do your project for you, make sure to tell it to use the tidyverse, not base R."
