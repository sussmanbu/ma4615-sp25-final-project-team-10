    "text": "Data Set 1: National Registry of Exonerations (https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx)\nOne data set we are considering for our project on racial disparities is the National Registry of Exonerations (NRE). This data set (3659 rows, 22 columns) tracks cases of wrongful convictions in the United States and provides detailed information about exonerees, including their race, age, crime type, conviction and exoneration dates, and factors that contributed to their wrongful conviction. The registry, maintained through a collaborative effort involving law schools, innocence organizations, and legal researchers, is designed to shed light on patterns of wrongful convictions and the systemic issues within the justice system. With over 3,000 recorded cases, this data set offers a valuable opportunity to explore how different factors—such as mistaken witness identification, false confessions, or official misconduct—affect exonerees from various racial backgrounds.\nBy analyzing this data, we hope to examine whether racial disparities exist in wrongful convictions and, if so, how they manifest. For instance, do Black exonerees experience official misconduct at a higher rate than white exonerees? Are certain crime types—such as drug offenses or homicides—more likely to lead to wrongful convictions for particular racial groups? Do certain factors—such as official misconduct, inaccurate forensic evidence, or eyewitness misidentification—disproportionately affect exonerees of particular racial groups? Additionally, we want to explore whether exonerees from different racial backgrounds serve significantly different amounts of time before being exonerated. From a practical standpoint, the data comes in a relatively well-structured spreadsheet format (although it is sometimes updated with new cases and additional fields). Loading it into a data analysis environment should be fairly straightforward. However, because this registry is compiled from many sources (court documents, news reports, legal filings, etc.), some challenges with missing or inconsistent data can arise. Despite these limitations, we believe this data set provides a powerful lens through which we can better understand inequities in the criminal justice system and contribute to discussions on how to address them.\nData Set 2: COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Race/Ethnicity - ARCHIVE (https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-State-Level-Data-Archive/qmgw-5kp6/about_data)\nAnother data set we are considering for our project on racial disparities is the COVID-19 State Level Data - Archive from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH). This dataset tracks state-level COVID-19 metrics and was actively updated until June 1, 2023. It includes 343 rows and 94 columns, offering comprehensive insights into COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing over time. The data provides cumulative and 7-day rolling metrics, covering confirmed and probable cases, test positivity rates, and reported deaths. The dataset offers an opportunity to investigate racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes by analyzing statewide trends. Some key questions we hope to explore include: How did COVID-19 case and mortality rates fluctuate over time? Were there significant racial disparities in infection rates and fatalities? How did policy changes, such as testing requirements, impact reported metrics? Additionally, since age-adjusted rates are not directly included, we may need to incorporate external demographic data to better understand disparities.\nFrom a technical perspective, the dataset is well-structured, making it feasible to load into a data analysis environment. However, there are challenges, such as missing data due to delayed reporting and the discontinuation of negative test result tracking after the federal public health emergency ended on May 11, 2023. Despite these limitations, this dataset provides a valuable historical record of state-level COVID-19 impacts and can contribute to broader discussions on health equity and pandemic response policies.\nData Set 3: Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-united-states-3f72f)\nThe third data set we are considering for our final project is the data on drug overdose death rates, by drug type and selected population characteristics. It includes 15 columns and 6229 rows, which is a large dataset that includes necessary information like gender, race, age to help us have a deeper understand of the trends and patterns surrounding drug overdose fatalities across various demographic groups. By capturing detailed breakdowns by gender, race, and age—along with year-to-year changes—this dataset enables us to pinpoint which subpopulations are most severely affected, how overdose rates have evolved over time, and where public health interventions may be most urgently needed. Some interesting questions we can research on: Are there particular racial or ethnic groups that appear to be disproportionately affected by drug overdoses, and how have these disparities evolved over time? Are there notable interactions between age and gender or age and race in overdose patterns, such as certain age brackets being more susceptible among specific demographic groups?\nFrom a techinical perspective, the dataset is well-organized and contains a rich array of demographic variables, making it feasible to load into most data analysis environments. However, there are challenges, such as potential inconsistencies in data reporting across different regions, limited data coverage for certain demographic groups, and possible variations in drug classification over time. Despite these limitations, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing patterns and trends in drug overdose fatalities, and it can contribute to broader public health discussions on prevention strategies, resource allocation, and policy-making."

    "text": "Designing Our Interactive Dashboard: Exploring Justice in Cook County\nAs we approach the final stretch of our project, we’ve started planning the interactive dashboard that will serve as the centerpiece of our analysis. Our goal is to build an interface that brings together two rich datasets—exonerations across the U.S. and crimes committed in Chicago since 2001—to explore systemic patterns of justice and injustice in Cook County. This dashboard won’t just display statistics—it will give users the ability to interact with and investigate the data on their own terms.\nCore Vision and Features\nAt the heart of our interactive will be the ability to see big picture trends—like how exonerations in Cook County have changed over time—and to zoom in on more granular comparisons, such as how often exonerations follow convictions for specific types of crimes. To achieve this, our dashboard will include:\n\nA timeline view showing the number of exonerations and total crimes over time (e.g., by year or month), allowing users to explore trends and compare timelines side by side.\nFilter options to narrow the dataset by crime type (e.g., homicide, drug offenses), race of the exoneree, and whether key tags like “DNA evidence” or “official misconduct” were involved.\nCounty focus: Since Cook County dominates the exoneration dataset and is the sole location in the crime dataset, this geographic focus lets users meaningfully explore the relationship between the two datasets in one place.\n\nWe also plan to implement clickable visual elements, such as a bar chart of the most common crimes that lead to exoneration. When a user clicks on a crime type (e.g., sexual assault), the entire dashboard would update to show:\n\nThe total number of crimes of that type reported in Chicago since 2010,\nThe number of exonerations tied to those crimes,\nAnd characteristics of those exoneration cases (race, age, evidence types, etc.)\n\nInteractivity for Exploration\nTo make the interactive feel interactive—not just visually dynamic—we’ll let users control their own exploration. This includes dropdowns, checkboxes, and sliders that filter the data and update charts in real time. Some specific ideas include:\n\nA year range slider to focus on certain time periods (e.g., post-2015),\nA race selector to explore how trends differ across racial groups,\nA checkbox panel for key exoneration tags like false confessions, perjury, or mistaken witness ID.\n\nThese features give users the tools to ask their own questions: Have exonerations increased in years when certain types of crimes spiked? Do some evidence types appear more often for Black exonerees than White exonerees?\nPersonal and Guided Experience\nWhile not all dashboards lend themselves to personalization, we see potential here. For example, users could filter the data by their own neighborhood (using ZIP code or community area) if we incorporate geolocation info from the crime data. This would allow a visitor from Chicago to explore: How many crimes have been reported near me? Are any exonerations tied to my area? This local perspective could help personalize the broader systemic patterns we’re analyzing.\nWe also plan to guide users through the dashboard with annotations and highlighted callouts—for example, pointing out that Cook County alone accounts for over X% of national exonerations, or flagging years with particularly high exoneration counts. These will serve as jumping-off points for users who don’t know where to start their exploration.\nCurrent Progress\nSo far, we’ve completed cleaning both datasets and written them to .rds files for quick loading. We’ve filtered the Chicago crime data to only include cases since 2010, and we’ve cleaned the exoneration data to allow easy filtering by county, crime type, and evidence tags. We have been analyzing patterns and trying to decide on our main question that we would like our dashboard to address. Our next steps are to build the visual components using shiny, plotly, or flexdashboard, and to link them together with reactive inputs.\nBy bringing together both datasets in an accessible and engaging format, we hope to help users better understand not just where injustice happens—but how it happens, who it affects, and what patterns lie beneath the surface."

    "text": "Combining Two Datasets for Deeper Insights\nOur initial analysis centered on the National Registry of Exonerations dataset, which captures cases where wrongfully convicted individuals were later exonerated. It gave us a unique perspective on how wrongful convictions occur and the factors—such as official misconduct or false confessions—that contribute to these errors. However, we are going to include at least one additional dataset to enrich our analysis. This week, we turned our attention to publicly available records of general crime data in Chicago, aiming to compare exoneration trends to the broader pool of convictions and reported crimes.\nSelecting the Chicago Crime Dataset\nWe chose to work with the “Crimes – 2001 to Present” dataset from the City of Chicago data portal. This dataset offers a comprehensive record of crimes reported in Chicago, including details such as the date of offense, type of crime, and location information. Beyond providing a large sample of data from a single metropolitan area, it directly complements our exoneration dataset: while our exoneration data focuses on cases where convictions were overturned, the Chicago crime data shows us the larger context of how many people are arrested, charged, and convicted of various offenses over time.\nCombining the Data\nSince our exoneration data covers the entire United States, we first will filter it to focus on Cook County, Illinois, where Chicago is located. We specifically chose Cook County because it stands out in the exonerations dataset, displaying one of the highest numbers of exonerations nationwide. This makes Cook County a particularly rich location for studying both wrongful convictions and overall crime trends (see graph below).\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Load the cleaned exoneration dataset\nexoneration_data &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset\", \"exoneration_data_clean.rds\"))\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Count exonerations by county and sort\ntop_counties &lt;- exoneration_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(County)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(State, County) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Exoneration_Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Exoneration_Count)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10) %&gt;%\n  mutate(County_Label = paste(County, \"(\", State, \")\", sep = \" \"))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(top_counties, aes(x = reorder(County_Label, Exoneration_Count), y = Exoneration_Count)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkred\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Counties with the Most Exonerations\",\n    x = \"County (State)\",\n    y = \"Number of Exonerations\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur initial plan is to align the two datasets primarily by date. We want to observe how exonerations in Cook County track alongside the volume and nature of crimes reported in Chicago over the same time span. For instance, we might compare annual trends: in years where Chicago saw higher rates of certain crimes (like homicide or assault), did we also see higher numbers of exonerations for those crimes later on?\nIn practice, combining the data means creating a common time structure—in this case, year or month-year—and then grouping or aggregating metrics from each dataset. In the exonerations data, we have case-level information (e.g., date of conviction or exoneration), while the Chicago crime data can be grouped by date reported or arrest date. We can then connect these by matching year (and possibly month) to compare how many crimes were committed versus how many exonerations occurred in that same window.\nInitial Findings and Challenges\nAlthough we are still in the early stages of combining the two datasets, we have already uncovered a few insights and challenges. First, Cook County’s exoneration cases span a wide range of years, including cases that started well before 2001 (the earliest date in our Chicago crime dataset). As a result, a direct one-to-one match for all exonerations is not possible. We’ll need to focus on exonerations that occurred or that began in the timeframe where Chicago crime data is available, and focus on trends from the big picture.\nSecond, the Chicago crime dataset is very large. It contains millions of rows of data since 2001, which can present performance challenges. We plan to filter it more narrowly, focusing on the worst crimes in our exoneration dataset—like homicide—so we can draw cleaner comparisons and avoid memory issues or very long processing times.\nLastly, we noted that our exoneration dataset tracks a different “lifecycle” of a criminal case. An exoneration might occur many years after the original conviction date. Meanwhile, the Chicago crime data captures the incident date and basic details of the offense but does not necessarily track outcome in the courts. Thus, comparing “crimes filed” to “exonerations” is more complex than a simple 1:1 join. We are approaching this by looking at broad trends rather than trying to match individual cases.\nNext Steps\nOver the coming week, we will refine our data filtering strategies and aggregation methods. We will likely create an annual-level panel that shows, for each year, the number of convictions (as recorded by arrests or charges in the Chicago crime data) versus the number of exonerations in Cook County for major crime categories. We then plan to explore:\n\nWhether spikes in reported crimes correlate with spikes in wrongful convictions a few years later.\nThe types of crimes most commonly associated with exonerations in Cook County, and how those compare to the overall crime landscape in Chicago.\n\nBy integrating these two datasets, we hope to provide a richer picture of how wrongful convictions fit into the broader criminal justice context in Chicago, and potentially highlight systemic issues that contribute to both wrongful convictions and crime trends more generally."

This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about.

A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

    "text": "Where to keep data?\nBelow 50mb: In dataset folder\nAbove 50mb: In dataset-ignore folder which you will have to create manually. This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

    "text": "Research Motivation and Questions\nOur project seeks to understand the factors that predict whether false evidence—such as official misconduct, perjury/false accusation, or false confessions—is involved in a wrongful conviction case. These elements not only raise serious ethical and legal concerns but may also signal systemic failures in the criminal justice process. The core question we ask is: What characteristics of a case or an individual are associated with the presence of false evidence?\nWe are particularly interested in demographic variables (e.g., race, sex, age), case-related variables (e.g., type of crime, DNA involvement), and legal procedures (e.g., mistaken witness identification). We hypothesize that wrongful convictions involving false evidence may disproportionately affect specific racial groups or younger defendants and may correlate with the absence of forensic support (e.g., DNA). These hypotheses are explored both through descriptive plots and through logistic regression modeling.\nData Sources and Collection\n\nNational Registry of Exonerations (NRE) This dataset was collected by a joint effort between the University of Michigan Law School, the University of California Irvine, and Michigan State University College of Law. It documents over 3,600 cases of wrongful convictions in the United States, along with rich details such as the race, age, and sex of exonerees, type of crime, and contributing factors like official misconduct, mistaken witness identification, or DNA evidence. It was curated to support legal research, reform efforts, and public awareness regarding flaws in the justice system.\nChicago Crimes 2001–Present Dataset This dataset is maintained by the Chicago Police Department and published through the City of Chicago’s open data portal. It records all reported crimes in Chicago, including type, location, time, and whether an arrest was made. While we’ve cleaned and prepared this dataset, our current analysis is focused on the NRE data, with plans to incorporate Chicago crime patterns in future modeling.\n\nWe cleaned and used exoneration_data_clean.rds and crime_data_2010_clean.rds. The NRE dataset provides case-level features such as: ·Race, Sex, Age ·State, County ·Worst_Crime_Display ·Convicted, Exonerated ·DNA, MWID, OM, P/FA, FC: Tags for DNA evidence, mistaken witness ID, official misconduct, perjury/false accusation, and false confession.\nWe derived a new binary variable, False_Evidence, defined as 1 if any of OM, P/FA, or FC is present. This is our primary modeling outcome.\nExploratory Data Insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Drug Possession or Sale and Murder clearly top the list, far exceeding other offenses in frequency. The prominence of these charges may reflect both the scale of their prosecution and their susceptibility to wrongful conviction—drug cases often involve questionable search procedures, while murder cases tend to rely on high-pressure investigations that may introduce coerced confessions or witness errors. Sexual Assault also ranks high, likely due to the significant role of flawed or misinterpreted forensic evidence in such cases. While crimes like Robbery and Burglary appear in the top ten, they occur at much lower rates. The dominance of severe offenses in this chart suggests that systemic problems—such as official misconduct, unreliable testimony, or investigative bias—are particularly prevalent, or at least more frequently uncovered, in high-stakes convictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: This histogram shows the distribution of exonerees’ ages at the time of their conviction. The majority were between 18 and 30 years old, suggesting that young adults are especially vulnerable to wrongful convictions. This pattern may stem from factors such as limited access to legal representation, increased susceptibility to coercion during interrogations, and targeted policing practices that disproportionately affect younger individuals. The distribution declines steadily with age, with very few exonerees convicted after age 50. These findings are consistent with existing research indicating that youth, particularly from marginalized backgrounds, are at heightened risk of being falsely accused or convicted.\nModeling and Inference\nWe used logistic regression to examine predictors of false evidence:\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = False_Evidence ~ Race + Sex + Age + Worst_Crime_Display + \n    DNA_binary + MWID_binary, family = binomial, data = model_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                                                   Estimate Std.

Interpretation\n·Race: None of the race variables were statistically significant at 5%, but some showed directionality (e.g., Hispanic ·and Black with positive estimates). ·Sex: Being male had a large negative coefficient but was not statistically significant. ·Age: A marginally significant effect (p = 0.085), where older age slightly reduced the odds of false evidence. ·Crime Type: Murder and Drug Possession had positive associations but were not significant. ·DNA_binary: Positive but non-significant. ·MWID_binary: Strong and significant negative association (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting mistaken ID is less likely to co-occur with false evidence.\nFit Metrics: ·Residual deviance: 69.1 on 456 df (from 146.8) ·AIC: 113.1 ·Indicates the model has strong separation power, though individual coefficients have high uncertainty due to sparse categories.\nLimitations Several limitations constrain our current analysis. First, the exoneration dataset captures only known wrongful convictions, meaning our findings reflect observed and documented cases—not the full universe of potential errors. Second, many variables are simplified binary tags (e.g., DNA = 1/0), which may obscure the complexity of evidence quality or legal procedures. Additionally, several crime types appear infrequently in the dataset, leading to large standard errors and unstable estimates in our logistic regression model. Finally, the analysis is cross-sectional rather than causal, and more granular or longitudinal data (e.g., case-level court transcripts, time to conviction/exoneration) would be needed to make stronger causal claims.\nConclusion Our analysis highlights key patterns in wrongful conviction cases involving false evidence. While demographic and crime-related variables show suggestive trends, mistaken witness identification emerges as a significant factor—negatively associated with false evidence. This insight may indicate that false evidence and mistaken ID are distinct pathways to wrongful convictions. Young adults remain disproportionately affected, as shown in both the model and descriptive visuals.\nAlthough constrained by binary simplifications and data sparsity, our model offers a preliminary view of what systemic risk factors may underlie certain conviction outcomes. Future work should include richer data (e.g., qualitative case summaries or trial records) and build temporal models that consider changes over time. Integrating external datasets like city-level crime or policy shifts may also strengthen causal inferences."

    "text": "Behind the Exoneration Surge: A Racial Reckoning\nEvery year, thousands of criminal cases play out in Cook County courts, ranging from non-violent drug offenses to the most serious charges of murder and assault. Buried within these prosecutions are two stories: the raw volume of reported crimes and the far smaller—but telling—number of cases later overturned as wrongful convictions. In this project, we bring together two complementary datasets to reveal a stark narrative of justice gone awry.\nThe first is the National Registry of Exonerations, a comprehensive record of every documented case in which a convicted individual was fully cleared by DNA evidence, official review boards, or other post-conviction mechanisms. It shows us not only which crimes most frequently result in exonerations, but also who those exonerees are—by age, race, and sex.\nThe second is the City of Chicago’s Crimes dataset, filtered here to Cook County. It catalogues every reported offense—its type, date, and location—giving us the backdrop of how many times each crime is prosecuted.\nBy placing these two datasets side by side, we can gain valuable insights.\nThesis Statement:\nIn Cook County, Black defendants are exonerated at far higher rates than white defendants—especially for violent crimes—revealing deep racial disparities in who is wrongly convicted and later cleared. This page explores a troubling pattern in Cook County’s justice system: violent crimes are more likely to lead to exoneration than non-violent crimes, and Black defendants are exonerated at significantly higher rates than white defendants—often 1.5 to 2 times as often. That doesn’t mean Black people are more likely to be innocent. It means they were more likely to be wrongly convicted in the first place.\nExplore the interactive dashboard here.\nWhen you land on our interactive dashboard, you’ll see two tabs along the top: Crime Trend and Exoneration Rates. Both are designed to put our central thesis—violent crimes are overturned more often than non-violent ones, and Black defendants face exoneration rates 1.5–2× those of white defendants—in your hands.\nCrime Trend\nClick on the Crime Trend tab, then use the dropdown menu to pick any offense—say, HOMICIDE or THEFT—and slide the year‐range selector to focus on exactly the period you care about. Immediately you’ll see a bar chart of “Number of … Cases by Year.” This lets you answer questions like:\n\nDid reported homicides peak in 2016 or 2017?\nHas theft in Cook County been steadily rising, falling, or bouncing around since 2010?\n\nBy toggling between violent (e.g. ASSAULT, ROBBERY) and non-violent categories (e.g. THEFT, NARCOTICS), you can compare their raw volumes and get a sense of the denominator for any exoneration rate.\nExoneration Rates (Murder)\nSwitch to the Exoneration Rates tab, where the default filter is set to Murder—our most common exonerated offense. What you’ll see is a multi-colored line chart of annual Cook County exonerations for murder, with one line each for Black, Hispanic, and White defendants (other races appear too sparsely to show here).\nFrom 2010 through about 2016, Black defendants experienced roughly 4–6 murder exonerations each year—consistently higher than any other group.\nWhite defendants average only about 1–2 exonerations per year, a fraction of the Black count.\nBeginning around 2017, Hispanic exonerations start to rise: they briefly match Black numbers in 2017, dip back, and then spike to 20 exonerations in 2021.\nBecause you can again adjust the year slider, it’s easy to isolate the COVID years (2020–21) when exonerations peaked for murder across all groups, or zoom out to see the longer trend since 2010.\nHow This Supports Our Thesis\nViolent vs. non-violent: By comparing the heights of bars in the Crime Trend tab for a violent crime like Murder against a non-violent crime like Theft, you see that violent crimes are prosecuted in smaller absolute numbers—but the exoneration line in the second tab still towers over the non-violent exoneration lines (if you switch filter), demonstrating a higher overturn rate per conviction.\nRacial disparity: In the Murder chart, the Black line sits 1.5–2× higher than the White line for every year you choose—exactly the gap our thesis predicts. Even during the 2021 spike, Hispanic exonerations surge, but Black exonerations remain elevated relative to White, underscoring persistent racial imbalances.\nBy flipping between these two views—raw crime counts and race-stratified exonerations for murder—you can see, year by year, that our justice system both prosecutes violent crimes rigorously and yet exonerates them disproportionately, especially for Black defendants. That dynamic visual story is exactly what our thesis set out to prove.\nBy comparing exoneration rates by crime type and race over time, we uncover how systemic bias can shape not just who is punished, but also who is eventually vindicated. These disparities don’t just reflect flaws in individual cases—they reveal larger patterns of racial injustice built into the system of arrest, prosecution, and review.\n\nFigure 1: Exonerations by Crime Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart shows that two of the most serious charges—Drug Possession or Sale and Murder—far outpace every other crime in the number of exonerations. In plain terms, the very offenses that carry the highest stakes and longest sentences also produce the most wrongful convictions. Because these heavy‐penalty crimes are so error-prone, the data tell us that violent and high-impact cases are disproportionately exonerated. That directly supports the first part of our thesis: violent offenses (like murder) are overturned at a higher rate than non-violent ones, even though they represent a smaller slice of total criminal filings. These aren’t minor slip-ups—they’re signs of deeper systemic failures. Murder convictions in particular often come from high-pressure investigations where mistakes, misconduct, or bias are more likely to occur.\n\n\nFigure 2: Age Distribution of Exonerees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that a huge majority of exonerees were between 18 and 30 years old at the time of conviction. This suggests that young adults—often newly navigating the criminal justice system—are especially vulnerable to mistakes, poor legal counsel, or coercion. While this chart doesn’t show race or crime type, it underscores a broader pattern: the system’s most severe failures tend to happen to young defendants, who are more likely to be charged with serious crimes and, as Figure 1 shows, later exonerated. Youth are more susceptible to false confessions, legal pressure, and poor representation. These aren’t just numbers—they reflect whose lives were most disrupted.\n\n\nFigure 3: Racial Disparities in Exonerations (Cook County Only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Black defendants dominate Cook County’s exoneration counts. That doesn’t mean they were treated fairly—it means they were more likely to be wrongfully convicted in the first place. They account for roughly 370 exonerations versus about 70 for Hispanics and only 30 for Whites. This stark imbalance demonstrates the second half of our thesis: Black defendants experience exoneration rates 1.5–2× those of White defendants—not because they are more innocent, but because they were more likely to be wrongfully convicted in the first place. The system isn’t correcting the error; it’s revealing how often it targeted the same group.\n\n\nFigure 4: Racial Proportion of Exonerations by Violent Crime in Cook County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart illustrates the racial breakdown of exonerations across four major categories of violent crimes in Cook County: Murder, Robbery, Assault, and Sexual Assault. In each category, Black defendants make up the overwhelming majority of those exonerated. In Robbery and Sexual Assault cases in particular, Black exonerees account for nearly all recorded exonerations.\nThis pattern does not reflect who commits crimes—it reveals who is more likely to be wrongfully convicted. The fact that Black defendants are exonerated at such disproportionate rates suggests that systemic bias operates not just at the point of conviction, but in the very mechanisms that later uncover and correct injustice. In other words, exoneration doesn’t prove the system worked—it shows where it broke.\nSummary & Reflection:\nThe thesis was simple: In Cook County, Black defendants are exonerated at much higher rates than white defendants—especially for violent crimes. Our figures confirm this, painting a portrait of a justice system that leans harder on Black communities and reserves its rare corrections for only the most severe cases.\nOur goal wasn’t just to show who gets exonerated—but to ask why they needed to be in the first place. These aren’t isolated errors. They are symptoms of a system that has long criminalized race and poverty more than it has pursued truth.\nCreativity:\nWhen we think of exonerations, we often picture a broken system finally setting things right. But in Cook County, the patterns of who gets exonerated tell a more disturbing story—not just about justice delayed, but justice distorted.\nStart with the crime. Violent offenses like murder and assault are more likely to be overturned than non-violent ones. That might sound logical—after all, they get more scrutiny. But that also means wrongful convictions for the most serious charges may be shockingly common.\nThen look at race. Black defendants are exonerated far more often than white defendants—not because they’re committing more crimes, but because they’re more likely to be wrongly accused, convicted, and imprisoned. These aren’t isolated mistakes. They’re signs of a system that historically leans harder on Black communities at every stage—from arrest to trial to sentencing.\nAnd then, the final twist: the same system that over-polices and over-convicts Black defendants is the one that only sometimes gets around to clearing them. The exoneration is not proof that the system worked—it’s proof that it failed.\nEach of the lines on our graph tells part of that story. They rise when justice catches up—but they exist in the first place because injustice got there first.\nInteractive component:\nUse the “Crime Trend” tab to see how the number of reported crimes in Cook County has changed over time. You can filter by specific offense types (like Theft or Assault) and focus on particular time periods using the slider. This gives important context for understanding the scale and types of criminal charges pursued in the county each year.\nThen, switch to the “Exoneration Rates” tab to explore how often people were later cleared of those crimes—broken down by race. You’ll see that Black defendants are consistently exonerated more often than any other group, especially for violent crimes. But that doesn’t mean they were treated fairly. It means they were more likely to be wrongly convicted in the first place.\nBy moving between the two tabs, you can trace the full arc of Cook County’s criminal justice system—from who gets charged to who ultimately gets a second chance—and who doesn’t."

    "text": "Data background\nThe data comes from the National Registry of Exonerations website, which is a collaborative project led by the Newkirk Center for Science & Society. The data is collected by researchers at the University of California Irvine, the University Michigan Law School, and the Michigan State University College of Law from court documents, news reports, and advocacy organizations, and other public sources to track whether a person’s conviction is overturned. This dataset is the original source as far as exoneration data goes.\nThere’s no issue with how the data was collected. The sample population is the group of people who have been officially exonerated, but it’s not a record of all wrongful convictions, just specifically cases in which someone was able to obtain an exoneration. Because the dataset only includes cases that achieved an exoneration, there’s probability that a lot of wrongful convictions never come to attention. Also, because of the publicly available information, some cases may have limited documentation, especially some older ones with fewer resources and publicity.\nThis data is used to research and analyze the causes and impacts of wrongful convictions, and its findings reflect systemic issues within the criminal justice system. Additionally, it provides a reference for policy-making to help prevent and reduce wrongful convictions while offering support for governance.Some other studies have also utilized the same data. For example, the American Statistical Association (ASA)’s Law and Justice Statistics Section has analyzed the frequency and distribution of wrongful convictions. The research article “Just Data: Advancing the Innocence Movement” also discusses the practical applications of NRE data in real life.The data provided by NRE has been used for policy decisions and has played a significant role in the development of criminal justice policies. Based on NRE data, researchers and policymakers have raised several important questions, such as: How does racial bias influence wrongful convictions? What reforms should be implemented to reduce such injustices? What are the common factors leading to wrongful convictions? The NRE data provides direction for improving the judicial system and helps prevent future miscarriages of justice.\nTo obtain the data, go to https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Spread-Sheet-Request-Form.aspx and fill out the form using your name and email. Shortly after, the website provides you with an Excel sheet which can be converted to a CSV file. We have included the CSV file in the dataset folder (our dataset is less than 50 MB). We also explored some ways to clean the data in the clean_data.R file in the scripts folder. For the most part, the data is already pretty easy to work with. Our cleaning script performs several key operations on the exoneration dataset. First, it renames column names by replacing spaces with underscores for easier access. It then converts the Age column to an integer, which may result in missing values (NA) if non-numeric entries exist. The Date of Crime Year column is cleaned by removing commas and converting it to an integer. Next, the script replaces all missing values with NA across the dataset, which may affect categorical variables like Tags or Worst Crime Display that might need “Unknown” instead."

    "text": "In our previous blog posts, we established foundational insights from the National Registry of Exonerations dataset. We uncovered broad trends—for example, that Black exonerees are overrepresented, homicide dominates the dataset, and that DNA evidence and false confessions appear disproportionately in specific crimes.This week, we began moving from exploratory analysis to explanatory analysis. Rather than simply observing that disparities exist, we aimed to dig deeper: · What factors predict whether false evidence is involved in a case? · Do these factors vary by race or crime type? · Can we start to model these outcomes with statistical tools?\nWe focused this week’s exploratory analysis on the role of false evidence (including official misconduct, perjury/false accusation, and false confession). We wanted to understand how often this occurs, and whether it disproportionately affects certain racial groups or certain crime types. We created a new binary column, False_Evidence, defined as cases with any of the following tags: · OM (Official Misconduct) · P/FA (Perjury or False Accusation) · FC (False Confession) Using this, we calculated the proportion of exonerees within each racial group whose cases involved false evidence.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Load the cleaned exoneration dataset\nexoneration_data &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset\", \"exoneration_data_clean.rds\"))\n# Create False_Evidence column\nexoneration_data &lt;- exoneration_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(False_Evidence = if_else(!is.na(`OM`) | !is.na(`P/FA`) | !is.na(`FC`), 1, 0))\n\n# Plot: False Evidence by Race\nexoneration_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Race) %&gt;%\n  summarize(FE_rate = mean(False_Evidence, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Race, FE_rate), y = FE_rate)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of False Evidence Cases by Race\",\n       x = \"Race\", y = \"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Insight: False Evidence Disparities by Race This chart shows the proportion of exonerees in each racial group whose cases involved false evidence—defined as the presence of official misconduct (OM), false confessions (FC), or perjury/false accusation (P/FA). · The highest proportion is found in the “Don’t Know” group, likely due to data entry uncertainty or legacy cases with incomplete documentation. · Among named racial groups, Black, Hispanic, and White exonerees all show relatively high proportions of false evidence cases—over 65% in each group. · Black exonerees have the highest known rate of false evidence involvement, slightly above Hispanic and White counterparts. This finding supports the hypothesis that racial disparities exist not only in wrongful convictions themselves but also in the mechanisms that cause them. · Asian, Native American, and “Other” groups show lower proportions, though these groups have smaller sample sizes, which may contribute to more variation or underreporting. Overall, this plot reinforces the importance of examining race as a structural factor influencing how and why wrongful convictions occur.\nWe also explored whether DNA evidence is more common in some types of crimes than others.\n\n# Plot: DNA Evidence by Worst Crime Type\nexoneration_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(DNA_binary = if_else(!is.na(DNA), 1, 0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Worst_Crime_Display) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Count = n(),\n            DNA_Rate = mean(DNA_binary, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Count)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(12, Count) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Worst_Crime_Display, DNA_Rate), y = DNA_Rate)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"DNA Evidence Rate by Crime Type\",\n       x = \"Crime Type\", y = \"Proportion with DNA Evidence\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Insight: DNA Evidence Varies Strongly by Crime Type\nThis plot illustrates how the use of DNA evidence in exoneration cases differs significantly across crime types. · Sexual assault cases overwhelmingly stand out, with over 65% of cases involving DNA evidence. This is likely due to the nature of such crimes, where biological evidence plays a central role in both prosecution and exoneration. · Murder and manslaughter follow as the next highest categories, each with around 30–40% DNA involvement, reflecting their severity and the likelihood of forensic investigation. · Crimes such as fraud, drug possession, and weapon-related offenses show very low rates of DNA evidence, typically below 5%, indicating that wrongful convictions in these categories are more likely driven by non-forensic factors like false accusations, misidentification, or official misconduct. · There’s a clear distinction between violent crimes (with high DNA rates) and non-violent or administrative crimes (with low or no DNA involvement).\nThese differences highlight the importance of contextualizing wrongful conviction mechanisms by crime type, and suggest that forensic evidence plays a far greater role in rectifying wrongful convictions for violent offenses.\nAs we begin modeling, we outlined a list of potential response variables and predictors, along with possible transformations to improve interpretability and predictive power：\nPotential Response Variables: Convicted / Exonerated – binary response (Yes/No) Posting Date / Date of Crime Year – can be used to compute “time to exoneration” or analyze trends over time Worst Crime Display – could be used as a categorical response for classification F/MFE (Female/Male False Evidence) – whether false evidence was involved (binary response)\nPotential Predictor Variables: Age Race Sex State / County Type of Crime (Worst Crime Display) Date of Crime Year DNA / MWID / OM Tags\nPossible Transformations: Binarize tags: turn tags like P/FA, DNA, MWID, etc. into separate binary columns (0 or 1) Compute sentence length: transform sentence text (“10 years”, “Life without parole”, etc.) into numeric values (e.g., Life = 99, or just flag it separately) Date differences: derive “time between conviction and posting”, or “time to exoneration” Group ages: create age groups (under 18, 18–25, 26–35, etc.) Simplify crimes: group crimes into broader categories (e.g., violent vs. non-violent)\nModeling Options: 1. Logistic Regression (binary outcomes) Predicting whether someone is exonerated (Yes/No) Predicting presence of DNA evidence or false evidence Predicting whether someone receives life sentence\n\nLinear Regression (continuous outcomes) Predicting sentence length (in years)\n\n\n# Prepare data\nmodel_data &lt;- exoneration_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(False_Evidence = if_else(!is.na(`OM`) | !is.na(`P/FA`) | !is.na(`FC`), 1, 0),\n         DNA_binary = if_else(!is.na(DNA), 1, 0),\n         MWID_binary = if_else(!is.na(MWID), 1, 0)) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(False_Evidence), !is.na(Race), !is.na(Sex), !is.na(Age), !is.na(Worst_Crime_Display))\n\n# Fit model\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(False_Evidence ~ Race + Sex + Age + Worst_Crime_Display + DNA_binary + MWID_binary,\n                   data = model_data, family = binomial)\n\n# Output summary\nsummary(logit_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = False_Evidence ~ Race + Sex + Age + Worst_Crime_Display + \n    DNA_binary + MWID_binary, family = binomial, data = model_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                                                   Estimate Std.

Being Black was significantly associated with higher odds of false evidence involvement (p = 0.027), controlling for other variables. Hispanic exonerees also showed a marginally significant effect (p ≈ 0.086). Other racial groups did not differ significantly from the reference category (likely Asian or Native American, depending on how factors were encoded).\nSex and Age: Male exonerees were significantly more likely to have false evidence involved in their case (p &lt; 0.001).Older age was associated with slightly lower odds of false evidence (p = 0.015), though the effect size is small.\nCrime Type: None of the crime types reached statistical significance. This may be due to multicollinearity or sparse data in many crime categories. Some estimates are unusually large or small with very high standard errors, suggesting overparameterization or poor category separation.\nDNA and MWID Evidence: Interestingly, the presence of DNA evidence was negatively associated with false evidence (estimate = -0.454, p = 0.0007). This could suggest that cases involving false evidence may lack concrete forensic support.Mistaken witness identification (MWID) had the strongest negative association with false evidence (estimate = -1.72, p &lt; 0.0001), which is intuitive—if a case hinges on mistaken ID, it may be less likely to also involve fabricated evidence.\nModel Fit: The residual deviance decreased from 4005.5 to 3271.1, indicating improved fit. AIC = 3381.1, which can be used for model comparison later."

After filtering, we grouped the data by year and crime type, and counted the number of reported incidents per group. This resulted in a clean, aggregated table of 120 rows (24 years × 5 crime types), which provides a structured yearly summary of serious criminal activity in Chicago.

We grouped the filtered data by conviction year and the variable Worst Crime Display, which indicates the most serious offense in each case, and calculated the number of exonerations per year for each crime type. To enable a valid comparison, we created a mapping table that aligns exoneration crime categories (e.g., “Murder”, “Sexual Assault”) with the Primary Type categories used in the Chicago crime dataset (e.g., “HOMICIDE”, “CRIM SEXUAL ASSAULT”). After applying this mapping, we joined the exoneration summary with the cleaned and aggregated Chicago crime data using both year and crime type as keys. The resulting combined dataset allows for side-by-side comparisons of how many people were convicted of certain serious crimes each year and how many were later exonerated, enabling a structured analysis of trends and disparities in the justice system over time.\n\nWhether spikes in reported crimes correlate with spikes in wrongful convictions a few years later.\n\nFrom the chart, there is no clear or consistent lagged correlation between spikes in crime reports and spikes in exonerations. For instance, HOMICIDE counts remain high and relatively stable across the early 2000s (e.g., 667 in 2001, 658 in 2002, 604 in 2003), while exoneration counts for those same conviction years fluctuate without a clear pattern (7 in 2001, 4 in 2002, 2 in 2003). Similarly, BURGLARY had high crime counts (25,623 in 2002), but very few corresponding exonerations (only 1). This suggests that while wrongful convictions are happening, they are not necessarily directly following spikes in reported crime at a systemic or predictable lag.\n\nThe types of crimes most commonly associated with exonerations in Cook County, and how those compare to the overall crime landscape in Chicago.\n\nThe data shows that HOMICIDE (mapped to “Murder”) is by far the most commonly associated crime with exonerations in Cook County. Nearly all years shown in the chart have homicide-related exonerations, with counts ranging from 2 to 7 per year. On the other hand, BURGLARY, while frequently reported (e.g., ~26,000 incidents per year), results in almost no exonerations. Similarly, ROBBERY and SEX OFFENSE categories have few to no exoneration entries despite high occurrence rates. This contrast suggests a disproportionate concentration of wrongful convictions in the most severe crimes, like homicides and sexual assaults. These are often cases with longer sentences and higher investigative scrutiny, where flawed evidence (e.g., eyewitness misidentification, coerced confessions, or prosecutorial misconduct) may have played a significant role and where advocacy efforts focus more intensively."

    "text": "As we move forward, our exploratory data analysis will deepen beyond simple time‐series comparisons. We plan to break down both crime and exoneration counts by subcategories—first into “violent” versus “nonviolent” offenses and then into more specific crime types—to see which segments drive the overall trends. We’ll layer in demographic and spatial context by merging tract-level data (such as median income and racial composition) and mapping crime locations alongside exoneration sites. We also intend to examine lagged relationships—testing whether spikes in certain crimes are followed, after a predictable delay, by increases in exonerations of those same offenses. Finally, we’ll look to bring in auxiliary data—like police staffing levels, the opening dates of conviction integrity units, or relevant policy changes—to see how these external factors coincide with shifts in exoneration rates.\nFor our central thesis, we are thinking of saying that, although reported crime volumes in Cook County have fluctuated over the past decade, the proportion of convictions that ultimately result in exonerations has steadily increased—especially for violent offenses. This suggests that enhanced post-conviction review mechanisms are catching more wrongful convictions, even if the overall exoneration rate remains low relative to total convictions. Every subsequent analysis in this project will serve to quantify the growth of that exoneration rate, demonstrate its variation across crime types and demographic groups, and explore the systemic factors that drive these patterns.\nTo ensure our findings are both clear and compelling, we will polish every visualization and table with careful attention to detail. Each figure will feature a concise, descriptive title—such as “Annual Exoneration Rate vs. Conviction Volume, Cook County, 2010–2023”—along with a one-sentence caption that highlights the key insight. We’ll annotate notable inflection points, like the launch of a new conviction integrity unit or a dramatic spike in exonerations, to guide readers’ attention. Consistent, color-blind–friendly palettes and a unified theme (minimal gridlines, clear axis labels, balanced line weights) will tie the visuals together. And in our Shiny embed, interactive elements—tooltips, hover highlights, and dynamic filters—will invite readers to explore the data themselves, making the story both informative and engaging.\n\n# Load libraries and cleaned data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\nexon &lt;- read_rds(here(\"dataset\", \"exoneration_data_cook.rds\"))\ncrime &lt;- read_rds(here(\"dataset-ignore\", \"crime_data_2010.rds\"))\n\n# 1.
