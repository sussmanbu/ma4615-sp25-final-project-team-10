Potential Response Variables:
Convicted / Exonerated – binary response (Yes/No)
Posting Date / Date of Crime Year – can be used to compute "time to exoneration" or analyze trends over time
Worst Crime Display – could be used as a categorical response for classification
F/MFE (Female/Male False Evidence) – whether false evidence was involved (binary response)

Potential Predictor Variables:
Age
Race
Sex
State / County
Type of Crime (Worst Crime Display)
Date of Crime Year
DNA / MWID / OM Tags

Possible Transformations:
Binarize tags: turn tags like P/FA, DNA, MWID, etc. into separate binary columns (0 or 1)
Compute sentence length: transform sentence text ("10 years", "Life without parole", etc.) into numeric values (e.g., Life = 99, or just flag it separately)
Date differences: derive "time between conviction and posting", or "time to exoneration"
Group ages: create age groups (under 18, 18–25, 26–35, etc.)
Simplify crimes: group crimes into broader categories (e.g., violent vs. non-violent)

Modeling Options:
1. Logistic Regression (binary outcomes)
Predicting whether someone is exonerated (Yes/No)
Predicting presence of DNA evidence or false evidence
Predicting whether someone receives life sentence

2. Linear Regression (continuous outcomes)
Predicting sentence length (in years)
